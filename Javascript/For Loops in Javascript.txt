A for loop in JavaScript is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code 
repeatedly for a specified number of times. The syntax for the for loop is as follows:

for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // code to be executed
}

The initialization statement is executed only once before the loop starts. It is used to initialize 
the loop variable. The condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the 
condition is true, the loop continues to execute. If the condition is false, the loop terminates. 
The iteration statement is executed at the end of each iteration of the loop, and it is used to update the loop variable.




Here's an example of a for loop that prints the numbers 1 to 5:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

In this example, the initialization statement initializes the loop variable i to 1. The condition statement 
checks if i is less than or equal to 5. The iteration statement increments i by 1 at the end of each iteration.




During each iteration of the loop, the code inside the curly braces is executed. In this case, the console.log(i) 
statement prints the value of i to the console.

The output of this code would be:


1
2
3
4
5

In summary, the for loop in JavaScript provides a convenient way to repeat a block of code a certain number 
of times, based on the condition and iteration statements provided.
